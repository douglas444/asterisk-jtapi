8 aug 2006; jw: patch from Martin Sladecek
	* Allow more then one context to be specified for terminalContext and
	  incomingContext. The internal list of contexts is expended, so JTAPI
	  will recognize all contexts that include the given contexts.
	  This change is for AMP, which uses multiple contexts for terminals and
	  multiple include stages.
