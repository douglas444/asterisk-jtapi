			<subsection name="Overview">
				<p>Asterisk-JTAPI is a JTAPI implementation for the Asterisk software PBX system.
				JTAPI is a provider independent programming interface for Java to build applications
				for computer telephony or to add support for it. JTAPI covers a wide range of usage
				scenarios starting from controlling a single telephone to a whole PBX
				system for example in call-centers.
				</p>
				<p>Asterisk-JTAPI builds on top of two other projects: Asterisk-Java, which provides
				a Java interface to the Asterisk manager API, and, GJTAPI, which provides
				a general framework for JTAPI interfaces.
				</p>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Features">
				<p>The first version tries to implement a very basic set of features but being as
				robust as possible.
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Signal incoming calls with calling party address, called party 
				address and final destination/terminal extension</li>
				<li>Signal outgoing calls</li>
				<li>Initiate outgoing calls</li>
				<li>Report alerting, established connection and termination</li>
				<li>Reports terminals and addresses to the appliation by analysing the
				   asterisk dialplan
				</li>
				<li>Support of all kinds of terminals. Tested with SIP phones and ISDN Zaptel interfaces.
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There is currently no support for advanced call-control features such as
				  call transfer, conference calls.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Known Limitations">
			<p>After a restart of the Java application no active calls are reported if some
				are established. This is not conforming to the JTAPI specification which states
				that after a restart any active call should be reported correctly and that snapshot
				events should be genereated. This is because we cannot get any needed 
				piece of information from the Asterisk PBX (e.g. called address).
			</p>
			<p>A transfered call is reported as a seperate call, so the final destination
			  only gets the internal calling party reported.
			</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Status">
				<p><b>V0.2 release, 15th May 2006:</b> 
				   The current code base is compliant to JTAPI 1.3.1 and
				   tested with Asterisk Version 1.2.4.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Download">
				<p>Official releases and release candidates are available on the <a 
					href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/asterisk-jtapi/">sourceforge 
					project page</a>.</p>

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Requirements">
				<p>At runtime Asterisk-JTAPI requires a Java Runtime 
					Environment (JRE) of at least version 1.4.</p>
				<p>You also need additional jar-files. Direct dependencies are
				   can be found <a href="dependencies.html">here</a>.</p>
